Updated Version 03/14/2018

Still needed: 
Should this live on github for now with a call out on developer.bigcommerce.com?
Will the npm install link be ready or should I add in how to install manually?
What else do you think is missing?
We should point out what each thing does like Charles mentioned. Please add more use cases to this list
There are 4 checkout options: 

**Customize design:** 
* One page checkout 
* Custome one page for devs
* Optimized One Page

**Replace Checkout using SDK**
* Optimized One Page

**The rest is done via the Storefront API**
* Address Verification
* Create carts
* Add Billing Address
* Multiple Shipping/Items
* Customer Login
* Current Customer

Klarna Checkout - where does this fall? Anything work with this option?


# BigCommerce Checkout SDK

The BigCommerce Checkout SDK allows for custom design to the Unified Checkout Out. By allowing Bigcommerce to handle the functionality, designers and developers can focus on creating a customized checkout experience. 


*Please note this is only available to our registered partners and Enterprise Clients at this time. **(Get guidance on lang)***

Checkout JS SDK provides you with the tools you need to build your own checkout solution for a BigCommerce store.


The SDK has a convenient application interface for starting and completing a checkout flow. Behind the interface, it handles all the necessary interactions with our Storefront APIs and other third-party SDKs. So you can focus on creating a UI that is unique to your business.

## What can you do with this?

The SDK comes with the Storefront API functionality. This includes the ability to create a quote, cart, order and customer. 
It can also get shipping and billing address, countries and payment methods. 

Initialize payment providers that need client-side setup such as: [Have others been added?]

* PayPal Express
* Braintree
* Stripe
* Square
* Amazon
* Klarna

---

Checkout State:

* Is the shopper currently logged in?
* Has the shopper entered a shipping or billing address?
* Has the shopper selected a shipping or payment method?
* Can the shopper enter payment details?
* Is the checkout form ready to submit?
* Should the shopper be redirected to the confirmation page?

---

Client-Side Validation: 

* Required fields are filled in
* Credit card format is valid
* Email address format is valid
* Custom form fields are valid

---

Provide a list of form fields for the view to render:

* Login form fields
* Billing form fields
* Shipping form fields
* Payment form fields




## Install

You can install this library using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

```sh
npm install --save @bigcommerce/checkout-sdk
```


## Requirements

### Browser support

We release the library in ES5 so you shouldn't have to do additional transpilation in order to use it. However, you do require the [Promise polyfill](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) if you need to support older browsers, such as IE11.

### Framework

The library is framework agnostic. In other words, you can use it with any UI framework or library you want.

### CORS

As our Storefront Web APIs currently don't support CORS, you may not be able to use the library outside of a BigCommerce store.


## Usage

Below are a few examples showing you some of the things you can do with the library.

### Initialize checkout

To create a `CheckoutService` instance and load the initial checkout state:

```js
import { createCheckoutService } from '@bigcommerce/checkout-sdk';

const service = createCheckoutService();

service.loadCheckout();
```

### Subscribe to data changes

To subscribe to changes to the current state:

```js
service.subscribe(({ checkout, errors, statuses }) => {
    // Return the current checkout
    console.log(checkout.getCheckout());

    // Return an error object if unable to load checkout
    console.log(errors.getLoadCheckoutError());

    // Return `true` if in the process of loading checkout
    console.log(statuses.isLoadingCheckout());
});
```

The subscriber gets triggered every time there is a state change. So you can use it to render the latest data in the view.

Once data is loaded, you can also get it outside of a subscriber:

```js
const { checkout } = service.getState();

console.log(checkout.getCheckout());
```

### Sign in shopper

To sign in a guest shopper to begin the checkout process:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.signInCustomer('foo@bar.com');

console.log(checkout.getCustomer());
```

Or to sign in a returning shopper:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.signInCustomer('foo@bar.com', 'password123');

console.log(checkout.getCustomer());
```

### Update shipping details

To set a shipping address for the order:

```js
const address = {
    firstName: 'Test',
    lastName: 'Tester',
    addressLine1: '12345 Testing Way',
    city: 'Some City',
    provinceCode: 'CA',
    postCode: '95555',
    countryCode: 'US',
    phone: '555-555-5555',
};

const { checkout } = await service.updateShippingAddress(address);

console.log(checkout.getShippingAddress());
```

To select a shipping option available for the shipping address:

```js
const address = checkout.getShippingAddress();
const options = checkout.getShippingOptions();

const { checkout } = await service.selectShippingOption(address.id, options[address.id].id);

console.log(checkout.getSelectedShippingOption());
```

### Update billing details

To set a billing address for the order:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.updateBillingAddress(address);

console.log(checkout.getBillingAddress());
```

### Apply coupon

To apply a coupon or gift certificate to the order:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.applyCoupon('COUPON');

console.log(checkout.getOrder().coupon);
```

```js
const { checkout } = await service.applyGiftCertificate('GIFT');

console.log(checkout.getOrder().giftCertificate);
```

To remove an applied coupon or gift certificate from the order:

```js
await service.removeCoupon('COUPON');
await service.removeGiftCertificate('COUPON');
```

### Load payment methods

To load available payment methods:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.loadPaymentMethods();

console.log(checkout.getPaymentMethods());
```

### Submit order

To submit the order with payment details and complete the checkout process:

```js
const payment = {
    name: 'testgateway',
    paymentData: {
        ccExpiry: { month: 10, year: 20 },
        ccName: 'BigCommerce',
        ccNumber: '4111111111111111',
        ccType: 'visa',
        ccCvv: 123,
    },
};

await service.submitOrder({ payment });
```

To submit the order using a hosted payment method:

```js
const payment = { name: 'braintreepaypal' };

await service.initializePaymentMethod(payment.name);
await service.submitOrder({ payment });
```

        return (
            <div>
                <Typography type="display1" gutterBottom>
                    Cart
                </Typography>

                <List>
                    { (this.props.cart.items || []).map((item) => (
                        <ListItem key={ item.id }>
                            <Avatar src={ item.imageUrl } />
                            <ListItemText primary={ `${item.quantity} x ${item.name}` } />
                            <ListItemSecondaryAction>
                                { formatMoney(item.amountAfterDiscount) }
                            </ListItemSecondaryAction>
                        </ListItem>
                    )) }
