# BigCommerce Checkout SDK

The BigCommerce Checkout SDK allows for custom design to the Unified Checkout Out. By allowing Bigcommerce to handle the functionality, designers and developers can focus on creating a customized checkout experience. 


*Please note this is only available to our registered partners and Enterprise Clients at this time. (Get guidance on lang)*

Checkout JS SDK provides you with the tools you need to build your own checkout solution for a BigCommerce store.


The SDK has a convenient application interface for starting and completing a checkout flow. Behind the interface, it handles all the necessary interactions with our Storefront APIs and other third-party SDKs. So you can focus on creating a UI that is unique to your business.


## Install

You can install this library using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

```sh
npm install --save @bigcommerce/checkout-sdk
```


## Requirements

### Browser support

We release the library in ES5 so you shouldn't have to do additional transpilation in order to use it. However, you do require the [Promise polyfill](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) if you need to support older browsers, such as IE11.

### Framework

The library is framework agnostic. In other words, you can use it with any UI framework or library you want.

### CORS

As our Storefront Web APIs currently don't support CORS, you may not be able to use the library outside of a BigCommerce store.


## Usage

Below are a few examples showing you some of the things you can do with the library.

### Initialize checkout

To create a `CheckoutService` instance and load the initial checkout state:

```js
import { createCheckoutService } from '@bigcommerce/checkout-sdk';

const service = createCheckoutService();

service.loadCheckout();
```

### Subscribe to data changes

To subscribe to changes to the current state:

```js
service.subscribe(({ checkout, errors, statuses }) => {
    // Return the current checkout
    console.log(checkout.getCheckout());

    // Return an error object if unable to load checkout
    console.log(errors.getLoadCheckoutError());

    // Return `true` if in the process of loading checkout
    console.log(statuses.isLoadingCheckout());
});
```

The subscriber gets triggered every time there is a state change. So you can use it to render the latest data in the view.

Once data is loaded, you can also get it outside of a subscriber:

```js
const { checkout } = service.getState();

console.log(checkout.getCheckout());
```

### Sign in shopper

To sign in a guest shopper to begin the checkout process:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.signInCustomer('foo@bar.com');

console.log(checkout.getCustomer());
```

Or to sign in a returning shopper:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.signInCustomer('foo@bar.com', 'password123');

console.log(checkout.getCustomer());
```

### Update shipping details

To set a shipping address for the order:

```js
const address = {
    firstName: 'Test',
    lastName: 'Tester',
    addressLine1: '12345 Testing Way',
    city: 'Some City',
    provinceCode: 'CA',
    postCode: '95555',
    countryCode: 'US',
    phone: '555-555-5555',
};

const { checkout } = await service.updateShippingAddress(address);

console.log(checkout.getShippingAddress());
```

To select a shipping option available for the shipping address:

```js
const address = checkout.getShippingAddress();
const options = checkout.getShippingOptions();

const { checkout } = await service.selectShippingOption(address.id, options[address.id].id);

console.log(checkout.getSelectedShippingOption());
```

### Update billing details

To set a billing address for the order:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.updateBillingAddress(address);

console.log(checkout.getBillingAddress());
```

### Apply coupon

To apply a coupon or gift certificate to the order:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.applyCoupon('COUPON');

console.log(checkout.getOrder().coupon);
```

```js
const { checkout } = await service.applyGiftCertificate('GIFT');

console.log(checkout.getOrder().giftCertificate);
```

To remove an applied coupon or gift certificate from the order:

```js
await service.removeCoupon('COUPON');
await service.removeGiftCertificate('COUPON');
```

### Load payment methods

To load available payment methods:

```js
const { checkout } = await service.loadPaymentMethods();

console.log(checkout.getPaymentMethods());
```

### Submit order

To submit the order with payment details and complete the checkout process:

```js
const payment = {
    name: 'testgateway',
    paymentData: {
        ccExpiry: { month: 10, year: 20 },
        ccName: 'BigCommerce',
        ccNumber: '4111111111111111',
        ccType: 'visa',
        ccCvv: 123,
    },
};

await service.submitOrder({ payment });
```

To submit the order using a hosted payment method:

```js
const payment = { name: 'braintreepaypal' };

await service.initializePaymentMethod(payment.name);
await service.submitOrder({ payment });
```

## Custom Components

Billing Components (React example)

```js

export default class BillingComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <form onSubmit={ (...args) => this._handleSubmit(...args) } noValidate>
                <Typography type="display1" gutterBottom>
                    Billing
                </Typography>

                <Address
                    address={ this.props.address }
                    countries={ this.props.countries }
                    onChange={ (formData) => this._handleAddressChange(formData) } />

                <Button type="submit">
                    Save
                </Button>
            </form>
        );
    }

    _handleAddressChange(address) {
        this._updatedAddress = address;
    }

    _handleSubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();

        this.props.onUpdate(this._updatedAddress || this.props.address);
    }
}


```
